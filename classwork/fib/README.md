(a.k.a. "dynamic optimization")
* Means of solving a complex problem by solving its component subproblems just once and storing their solutions

# MEMOIZATION
* Technique of storing solutions to subproblems to avoid re-computation
<br>
OR
<br>
* Use of caches to retrieve previously computed values to reduce time complexity of algorithms
